            <div id="intro1" class="text jokji on">Hello! Welcome to my second game. This is a text-based game with some real life visuals included, notice the little grey house down there? That's where our game lives this time, instead of with us in the real world.</div>
            <div id="intro2" class="text jokji">Do you remember how we played my first game? This one is a little bit similar, but it might take you a little longer. There are going to be four of what I like to call 'rooms' with four items in each room.</div>
            <div id="intro3" class="text jokji">Unlike the last time, where winning or losing didn't really matter, you'll be scored depending on how well you choose your items. But there are many different ways to choose, I didn't just pick one way.</div>
            <div id="intro4" class="text jokji">The way to get the highest score is to make sure your items are cohesive with each other, either by color, size, or concept. I will be watching closely so try your hardest.</div>
            <div id="intro5" class="text jokji">Are you ready? You may pick up the little house I've built for you now.</div>
